		<h2>Bubbling and capturing</h2>
        <h3>Let’s start with an example.</h3>

            <h3>Code samples</h3>
            <pre>
                <code>&lt;div onclick="alert('The handler!')"&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;em&gt;If you click on &lt;code&gt;EM&lt;/code&gt;,the handler on &lt;code&gt;DIV&lt;/code&gt;runs.&lt;/em&gt;</code>
                <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code>
            </pre>

        <div onclick="alert('The handler!')">
            <em>If you click on <code>EM</code>, the handler on <code>DIV</code> runs.</em>
        </div>
        <p>Isn’t it a bit strange? Why the handler on <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> runs if the actual click was on <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>? </p>

		<h2>Bubbling</h2>
		<p>The bubbling principle is simple.</p>
        <h2>When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the way up on other ancestors.</h2>
	</section>

<!-- 3. slajd -->

    <section class="slide">
            <h2>Example</h2>
        <pre>
            <code>&lt;form onclick="alert('form')"&gt;FORM </code>
            <code>&lt;div onclick="alert('div')"&gt;DIV </code>
            <code>&lt;p onclick="alert('p')"&gt;P </code>
        </pre>

        <p>Ako kliknemo unutar <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, kojim redom ce se dogadjaji izvrsavati?</p>
        <p>1. FORM, DIV, P</p>
        <p>2. P, DIV, FORM</p>
        <p>3. DIV, P, FORM</p>
    </section>


    <section class="slide">
        <form class="bord" id="form" >FORM
            <div class="bord" id="div">DIV
                <p class="bord" id="p">P</p>
            </div>
        </form>

        <p>A click on the inner <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> first runs onclick:</p>

        <p>On that <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</p>
        <p>Then on the outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> </p>
        <p>Then on the outer <code>&lt;form&gt;</code></p>
        <p>And so on upwards till the document object.</p>
    </section>


	<section class="slide">
        <img src="pictures/bubbling.png" alt="bubbling"/>
		<h5>So if we click on <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, then we’ll see 3 alerts: p → div → form.
		The process is called “bubbling”, because events “bubble” from the inner element up through parents like a bubble in the water.</h5>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<p><b>Almost all events bubble!</b></p>
		<p>The key word in this phrase is “almost”.</p>
		<p>For instance, a focus event does not bubble. There are other examples too. But still it’s an exception, rather than a rule, most events do bubble.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>event.target</h2>
		<p><b>The most deeply nested element that caused the event is called a target element, accessible as event.target.</b></p>

		<p>Note the differences from this (=event.currentTarget):</p>

		<ol>
			<li>event.target – is the “target” element that initiated the event, it doesn’t change through the bubbling process.</li>
			<li>this – is the “current” element, the one that has a currently running handler on it.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>Stop bubbling</h2>
		<p>A bubbling event goes from the target element straight up. Normally it goes upwards till <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, and then to document object, and some events even reach window, calling all handlers on the path.

		But any handler may decide that the event has been fully processed and stop the bubbling.</p>

		<p>The method for it is <b>event.stopPropagation().</b></p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide" id="picture">
		<p>For instance, here body.onclick doesn’t work if you click on <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>: </p>

		<pre>
			<code>&lt;body onclick="alert(`the bubbling doesn't reach here`)"&gt;</code>
			<code>&lt;button onclick="event.stopPropagation()"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;</code>
			<code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
		</pre>

		<p onclick="alert(`the bubbling doesn't reach here`)">
		<button onclick="event.stopPropagation()">Click me</button>
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>event.stopImmediatePropagation</h2>
		<p>Prevents other listeners of the same event from being called.</p>
		<p>If several listeners are attached to the same element for the same event type, they are called in order in which they have been added. If during one such call, event.stopImmediatePropagation() is called, no remaining listeners will be called.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2 class="shout shrink">!!!</h2>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<h5>If an element has multiple event handlers on a single event, then even if one of them stops the bubbling, the other ones still execute.In other words, event.stopPropagation() stops the move upwards, but on the current element all other handlers will run.To stop the bubbling and prevent handlers on the current element from running, there’s a method event.stopImmediatePropagation(). After it no other handlers execute.</h5>
		<h5><b>Don’t stop bubbling without a need!</b></h5>
			<p>Bubbling is convenient. Don’t stop it without a real need: obvious and architecturally well-thought. Sometimes event.stopPropagation() creates hidden pitfalls that later may become problems.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>Capturing</h2>

		<p>There’s another phase of event processing called “capturing”. It is rarely used in real code, but sometimes can be useful.</p>

		<p>The standard DOM Events describes 3 phases of event propagation:</p>

		<p><b>Capturing phase</b> – the event goes down to the element.</p>
		<p><b>Target phase</b> – the event reached the target element.<p>
		<p><b>Bubbling phase</b> – the event bubbles up from the element.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<img src="pictures/phases.png" alt="phases" style="height: 400px;"/>
		<p>That is: for a click on <code>&lt;td</code>&gt; the event first goes through the ancestors chain down to the element (capturing), then it reaches the target, and then it goes up (bubbles), calling handlers on its way.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<p>	To catch an event on the capturing phase, we need to set the <b>3rd argument</b> of addEventListener to <b>true</b>.</p>

		<p>There are two possible values for that optional last argument:</p>

		<p>If it’s <b>false</b> (default), then the handler is set on the bubbling phase.</p>
		<p>If it’s <b>true</b>, then the handler is set on the capturing phase.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">

		<form id="form1" class="bord">FORM
			<div id="div1" class="bord">DIV
				<p id="p1" class="bord">P</p>
			</div>
		</form>

		<p>Describe a process if you click on <code>&lt;p</code>&gt; in capture phase and bubbling phase.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<p>If you click on <code>&lt;p</code>&gt;, then the sequence is:</p>

		<p>HTML → BODY → FORM → DIV → P (capturing phase, the first listener), and then:</p>
		<p>P → DIV → FORM → BODY → HTML (bubbling phase, the second listener).</p>

	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>Cancelable event</h2>
		<p>
			Events' cancelable property indicates if the event can be canceled, and therefore prevented as if the event never happened. If the event is not cancelable, then its cancelable property will be false and the event listener cannot stop the event from occurring.
			Calling preventDefault() on uncancelable events produces errors, so event listeners that handle multiple kinds of events may want to check cancelable before invoking their preventDefault() methods.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<p>
		Most browser-native events that can be canceled are the ones that result from the user interacting with the page. Canceling the click, scroll, or beforeunload events would prevent the user from clicking on something, scrolling the page, or navigating away from the page, respectively.
		Custom events created by other JavaScript code control if they can be canceled when they are created</p>
		<p>Syntax: <b> bool = event.cancelable</b></p>
		<p>The result is a Boolean, which is true if the event can be canceled.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<h2>SUMMARY</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				When an event happens – the most nested element where it happens gets labeled as the “target element” (event.target).
			</li>
			<li>
				Then the event first moves from the document root down the event.target,
				calling handlers assigned with addEventListener(...., true) on the way.
			</li>

			<li>
				Then the event moves from event.target up to the root,
				calling handlers assigned using on<code>&lt;event</code>&gt;
				and addEventListener without the 3rd argument or with the 3rd argument false.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</section>

	<section class="slide">
		<p>Each handler can access event object properties:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>event.target – the deepest element that originated the event.</li>
			<li>event.currentTarget (=this) – the current element that handles the event (the one that has the handler on it)</li>
			<li>event.eventPhase – the current phase (capturing=1, bubbling=3).</li>
		</li>
			<p>Any event handler can stop the event by calling event.stopPropagation(), but that’s not recommended, because we can’t really be sure we won’t need it above, maybe for completely different things.</p>
		</ul>
